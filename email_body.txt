Hi Tarun,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to express my interest in Data Analyst role. With a strong background in data analysis, business intelligence, and problem-solving, I am eager to contribute to your team.

In my role as an Associate System Engineer at TCS, I have developed BI reports, built data models, and provided actionable insights to enhance decision-making. My experience with Machine Learning, Web Development, Python, C++, DSA, Pandas, Power BI, SQL, and data visualization, combined with my ability to understand business requirements, aligns well with these roles. Additionally, my academic projects in sales analytics, machine failure prediction, and other data-driven solutions demonstrate my ability to translate complex datasets into meaningful strategies.

I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills can benefit your organization. Please find my resume attached for your review. Looking forward to your response.
